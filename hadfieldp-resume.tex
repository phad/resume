    % Profile
    \section{\mysidestyle Profile}

    Paul is a software engineer with seventeen years of experience in object-oriented design and development
    in C++  on Symbian, and two years experience of Java on Linux and Android.  His server experience at Google
    includes design and deployment of a distributed search service for mobile apps, using Borg, GFS, Bigtable,
    Map-Reduce and other Google technologies.  His Symbian development experience spans releases 6.0 to 9.2
    of Symbian OS with a focus on S60 UI and the area of client-side application protocols.
    Paul has a record of fostering communicative and productive teams across multiple
    time-zones. His previous roles have often been customer-facing, and Paul has sat on standardisation bodies.
    Paul is passionate about developing usable software in an Agile team setting with a focus on prototyping and
    test-driven development.

    % Current Role
    \section{\mysidestyle Current Role}

    Since January I've worked as a software engineer on Google's Android Market team, and am involved in
    development of features on both server and client side.  Server-side, I'm working on an analysis pipeline using
    Map-Reduce.  Client-side, I'm working on various unreleased new UI features in the Market client for tablet.
    
    Prior to joining the Android team, I worked on Google's `Mobile App Search' product, which adds results for mobile
    applications to Google's mobile search results.  I was the first of three engineers to join this team, and consequently
    did most of the early prototyping and architectural design work.  I've implemented a crawler which scrapes all apps
    on the Apple App Store, merges with in-house data from Android Marketplace into a unified data repository. This
    repository is then queried by Mobile Search when the user demonstrates intent to find apps to install on their phone.
    
    I was also responsible for designing a
    server implementation that is robust and redundant, deploying it across Google's production grid, and setting up
    monitoring systems that check health, alert on failures, and gather statistics on performance and usage.  I also set up
    our continuous integration system and have been a driver behind our effort to improve test coverage.  My recent work
    has improved by 2-3x the freshness of our repository data by refactoring our data processing pipeline to work on
    smaller chunks of data in a more continuous manner.
